# First-mini-project
for css and html class first website uploaded to github
1st: added doctype html lang
2nd added header
3rd added body with footers containing elements and attributes that have the header stay at the top even when scrolling
4th added links and references to those links with each button also added gray text to "enter email" area
5th added change color elements when hovering over buttons and ease into a new color
6th added more elements to align everything
7th added backround image in a 1920x1080 size centered and to not repeat 
8th added a new text box at the bottom of the webpage to indicate its the bottom and allow for scrolling
9th played with size and alignment for text
10th troubleshooted a lot


problems i had:
1: the send button didnt changed color or go to a link, turns out i was missing a ; and : in 2 lines of code
2: backround image never scaled to full screen when set to stretch fill 100% just used 1920x1080 pixel instead. just now realizing because i used a 1920x1080p monitor to code, my 1440p monitor makes the webpage have a white right side.
3: never got to add a image to the center of the webpage on top of the backround
4. i wanted to give up after the button not working situation but kept coding even without it and at the very end figured out what the problem was.
5. THE RED LINES UNDERNEATH TEXT HELPS A LOT WHEN DEBUGGING AND I NEVER USED IT TILL NOW AHHHH

thank you
